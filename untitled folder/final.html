“Pick up the coins, you cheap Jew!” This is what I heard repeatedly as pennies were hurled at me by my supposed “friends". There I was, at a middle school social gathering seeing firsthand the reality of ignorance and discrimination. At that moment, I was devastated. But little did I know this moment would turn me into the stronger person I am today. </p>

<p>I had it easy. While this was a horrible situation, many people have been victimized by hate crimes much worse than what I went through. Not only is the subject of hate crimes personal to me but it is also a very common issue that continues to not be stopped.
Looking into this, I found a dataset including all confirmed hate crime incidents in New York City recorded by the NYPD from 2019 to 2022.</p>

<p>Looking into this, I found a dataset including all confirmed hate crime incidents in New York City recorded by the NYPD from 2019 to 2022. It’s noted that out of all the groups victimized in the dataset the Jewish population has had the most recorded incidents targeted against them. This fully displays how antisemitism is still a major problem in the United States. 
</p>
	<h3>Summary of the Dataset</h3>
			<p>This dataset includes all the confirmed hate crime incidents recorded by the NYPD that have taken place between the years of 2019 to 2022 in the state of New York. The dataset is very detailed having columns spanning from all the minority groups targeted, to the offense that was committed towards them, to the motive behind the crime. Out of the minority groups targeted, the Jewish community has been victimized the most over the past three years.</p>

				<p> This is newsworthy because antisemitism is rising in the United States. It’s becoming a major issue and is starting to run rapidly from schools to the workplace. Social media definitely has contributed to this problem as communication outlets like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and other platforms have allowed users to say whatever is on their mind while hiding behind their screens without any consequences. Today’s celebrities have also contributed to this problem. Individuals like Kanye West and Kyrie Irving have used their massive online platforms to share their delusional opinions about Judaism towards the public in an attempt to skew their thoughts on the religion. Of course, the majority of people who have seen these statements online have noticed how moronic these celebrities are yet what sparks controversy are the naive fans who worship these celebrities like gods. These fans will openly and cooperatively adapt and restate everything their heroes have been saying even if it is harmful. The NYPD Crime Stoppers recorded an attack involving one of these fans as they reported on Perin Jacobchuk who hit a 63-year-old hasidic Jewish, causing him to break his hand and chip his tooth while making antisemitic remarks. Luke Tress (of the Times of Israel) gave more information on the subject stating, ‘“The victim was Hewish and the attacker yelled “Kanye 2024” during the assault, referring to antisemitic rapper Kanye West.”’<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/police-data-shows-antisemitic-incidents-in-nyc-more-than-doubled-over-last-2-years/">TimesofIsrael</a></p>

<h3>Findings</h3>
	<p>My first visual is a grouped bars chart of all the religious groups that have been targeted between 2019 to 2022 and the amount of recorded hate crimes each of them faced in New York. Diving deeper into the numbers and the data itself, it is noted that the Jewish population has been targeted 866 times. This is 43.97% percent of the total amount of hate crimes that have been recorded from all the religions! </p>
	
	<p>Luke Tress of the Times of Israel also reported more on these numbers. He stated, “The rise in hate crimes in New York corresponds with nationwide trends. The ADL recorded 2,717 antisemitic incidents across the country in 2021, a 34% increase from the previous year, and the highest since it began tracking in 1979.”</P>

<h3>More Insight of the Issue</h3>
	<p> My next visual is a column chart that examines the most common types of hate crimes recorded against the Jewish community between 2019 to 2022. The top three crimes committed were assault and related offenses, offenses against public ordinance and criminal mischief and offenses related to it. Criminal Mischief was by far the most common hate crime committed with 217 different recorded events. According to <a href="https://www.new-york-lawyers.org/criminal-mischief.html">NewYorkLawyers.org</a>, in the state of New York, Criminal Mischief involves hate crimes in which the perpetrator would recklessly damage the property of the victim without consent. </p>
<p>To former NYPD police officer Anthony Alesia this isn’t shocking as he has dealt with multiple mischief related incidents throughout his career. “I saw multiple swastikas spray painted on people’s fences.” Alesia also talked about a common motive people have in mind when committing hate crimes. He stated, “ I saw a lot of hate crimes based on money and jealousy and hurting people who are doing well.” 
Outside of committing an offense out of hatred towards a specific religion Alesia’s take paints a clearer picture as to why criminals target certain groups. </p>

</script>
			<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
			<p>The numbers speak for themselves. Despite what people say antisemitism is a major issue in the United States and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. However there is hope. Outside of the small percent of hate, a lot of people have been standing up for what's right. Whether it's for the Jewish population or for another minority group, rising against hate will make the world a better place. This will help us coexist.
